This is the official repository for **Attention Residuals (AttnRes)**, a drop-in replacement for standard residual connections in Transformers that enables each layer to *selectively* aggregate earlier representations via learned, input-dependent attention over depth.

## Overview

Standard residual connections accumulate all layer outputs with fixed unit weights. As depth grows, this uniform aggregation dilutes each layer's contribution and causes hidden-state magnitudes to grow unboundedly — a well-known problem with PreNorm.

**AttnRes** replaces this fixed accumulation with softmax attention over preceding layer outputs:

$$\mathbf{h}_l = \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \alpha_{i \to l} \cdot \mathbf{v}_i$$

where the weights $\alpha_{i \to l}$ are computed via a single learned pseudo-query $\mathbf{w}_l \in \mathbb{R}^d$ per layer. This gives every layer selective, content-aware access to all earlier representations.

### Block AttnRes

Full AttnRes is straightforward but requires O(Ld) memory at scale. **Block AttnRes** partitions layers into N blocks, accumulates within each block via standard residuals, and applies attention only over block-level representations. With ~8 blocks, it recovers most of Full AttnRes's gains while serving as a practical drop-in replacement with marginal overhead.

## Results

### Scaling Laws

AttnRes consistently outperforms the baseline across all compute budgets. Block AttnRes matches the loss of a baseline trained with **1.25x more compute**.

### Downstream Performance (Kimi Linear 48B / 3B activated, 1.4T tokens)

| Category | Benchmark | Baseline | AttnRes |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| General | MMLU | 73.5 | **74.6** |
| | GPQA-Diamond | 36.9 | **44.4** |
| | BBH | 76.3 | **78.0** |
| | TriviaQA | 69.9 | **71.8** |
| Math & Code | Math | 53.5 | **57.1** |
| | HumanEval | 59.1 | **62.2** |
| | MBPP | 72.0 | **73.9** |
| Chinese | CMMLU | 82.0 | **82.9** |
| | C-Eval | 79.6 | **82.5** |

AttnRes improves across the board, with the largest gains on multi-step reasoning (+7.5 on GPQA-Diamond) and code generation (+3.1 on HumanEval).

### Training Dynamics

AttnRes mitigates PreNorm dilution: output magnitudes remain bounded across depth and gradient norms distribute more uniformly across layers.
